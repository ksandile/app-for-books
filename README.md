# BookApp

This project is called **BookApp** and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

To get started with BookApp, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bookapp.git
cd bookapp
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Start the Application

To start the app in development mode, run:

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.

### Step 4: Run the API

To display the items in BookApp, you will need to run the Server(API) provided at this link:  
[https://github.com/ksandile/book-serverAPI](https://github.com/ksandile/book-serverAPI)

Follow the instructions in the `book-serverAPI` repository to set up and run the API locally. Once the API is running, it will provide the data that BookApp uses to display book information.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can also run:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more information, refer to [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production and outputs it to the `build` folder. This bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance. Your app is then ready for deployment.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot undo this.** 

This command allows you to customize the configuration of Create React App by exposing the build files and configuration settings like Webpack, Babel, etc.
